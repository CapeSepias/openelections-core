    The standardized filename for this results file is
    `20101102__ia__general__clinton__precinct.xls`.

    A separate class is needed because the structure of this county's file is
    significantly different from most of the other results files for this
    election.

    The file has a single worksheet with rows of the sheet grouped by precinct
    and then by office.

    Precinct groups begin with a heading in the first column of a row with
    a format like "NNNN PRECINCT NAME", for example "0001 BLOOMFIELD DELMAR".

    Office groups follow the format:

    OFFICE NAME
    VOTE FOR NO MORE THAN 1
    Candidate Name (PARTY ABRREV).  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    WRITE-IN.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    Over Votes .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
    Under Votes .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

    Note the period characters following the candidate names.

    Office groups are separated by an empty row.

    Result rows have the following columns (from left to right):

    * Total votes
    * %
    * Absentee
    * Election day
